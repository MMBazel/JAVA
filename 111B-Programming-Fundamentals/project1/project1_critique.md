Extra Credit: +10

Nice work! I like the comments/documentations.
(Edison L.)

I feel like interest rates should be a double, for APY's like 0.06%, 0.90%, 1.05%

In the constructor,
-3 if some of the parameters are invalid, you need to still initialize the others and then also use default values; otherwise, you can end up with an object that is only partially set up

-3 in withdraw, check that parameter is a positive value



-10 from extra credit: missing addInterest method
