Project EC: Animal Kingdom
This project is optional extra credit.

Note that because of when final grades are due, there are no late submissions accepted of this project. 

Write classes and interfaces to represent the following:

Adoptable
Amphibian
Animal
Dog
Frog
Goldfish
Mammal
WaterLiveable
Whale
You need to decide on the structure. Consider:

Which should be an abstract class?
Which should be an interface?
How should the classes be related through inheritance?
In what classes should methods be placed?
What methods should be overridden?
Some additional details/requirements:

All animals have a name.
All animals have a toString method that should returns the animal's name.
All animals have a method "isWarmBlooded" that returns a boolean.
Animals that can be adopted as pets have a method "getHomecareInstructions" that return a description of how to care for the animal.
Animals that can live in water have a method "canLiveOnLand" that returns a boolean of whether the animal can also live on land.
This assignment isn't necessarily difficult from a programming perspective. What you should spend time on  is carefully considering the design of you classes and how they should be related through inheritance or interfaces. To get full credit:

Your class hierarchy should make sense. (You can assume common knowledge or "googleable" facts about animals- you won't be graded on your biology knowledge!)
Place common code as high up in the hierarchy as possible. Avoid repeating code.
Declare classes that should not be instantiated as abstract.
In abstract classes, methods that must be implemented by all subclasses should be declared abstract.
Remember that classes can only have one parent but can implement multiple interfaces.
To submit your program, zip your 9 files together and upload the zip file. If submitting as a group, submit one assignment only through one group member's Insight account. Put the names of all group members in Java comments at the top of each Java file.
